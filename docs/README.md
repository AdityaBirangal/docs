Welcome to the Iden3 developer portal. Here you'll find eveything you need to get started building with Iden3.

## What is Iden3 and what are its aims

Iden3 is an open source project offering a complete decentralized identity management solution over the public blockchain. It is designed with four fundamental goals in mind:

**Enable Self Sovereign Identities**, whereby identities are created, owned and controlled by the user.

**Accessibility**, by promoting the development of open standards and ease of use.

**Scalability**, by minimizing the number of accesses to the blockchain that identity management and claim processing requires.   

**Privacy by design** by using Zero Knowledge Proofs to prove claims without revealing any information other than the validity of the claim.

## Introduction

>Identity is a uniquely human concept. It is that ineffable “I” of self-consciousness, something that is understood worldwide by every person living in every culture. As René Descartes said, Cogito ergo sum — I think, therefore I am. [Source](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html)

 What constitutes your identity? What makes you who you are? What is it about you that distinguishes you from others? Philosophers have argued over these questions since the beginning of civilization. Suffice to say there are no simple answers. Identity is a difficult concept to pin down.

 However, we don't need a precise definition to see that there are problems with how modern society thinks about identity.

 In the words of [Christopher Allen](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html):

>Today, nations and corporations conflate driver’s licenses, social security cards, and other state-issued credentials with identity; this is problematic because it suggests a person can lose his very identity if a state revokes his credentials or even if he just crosses state borders. I think, but I am not.

How can we improve on this?

It's clear we're at an inflection point with respect to how the digital world interacts with the physical world.

The legacy systems of the physical world have not kept up with the digital world's rising importance to it. As both worlds continue merging, this will have to change.

This gives us an opportunity to create systems -- from the ground up -- that bridge the two. Systems that operate with a different conception of identity.

If we design them well, they will allow us to redefine how modern society thinks about identity. Perhaps getting us closer to that ineffable "I" of self-consciousness.

At Iden3 we're focused on building the tools and developing the protocols to make this happen.
