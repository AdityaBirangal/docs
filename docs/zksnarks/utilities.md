## Circom

[Circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) is a library that allows you to build circuits to be used in zero knowledge proofs. More formally, it's a circuit compiler for zk-snarks.

In particular, it's designed to work well with [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs): an independent implementation of the zk-snarks protocol -- fully written in JavaScript.

For a guide on how to get started with circom and snarkjs, see [here](../../guides/circom-and-snarkjs.md).

## Circomlib

[Circomlib](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib) is a library containing circuits implemented in [circom](zksnarks/utilities/circom.md).

It contains an implementation of the [Pederson Hash](https://github.com/iden3/iden3-docs/blob/master/source/iden3_repos/research/publications/zkproof-standards-workshop-2/pedersen-hash/pedersen.rst) and Exponentiation circuits using the [Baby-Jubjub](https://github.com/iden3/iden3-docs/blob/master/source/iden3_repos/research/publications/zkproof-standards-workshop-2/baby-jubjub/baby-jubjub.rst) elliptic Curve.

## Snarkjs

[Snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs) is an independent implementation of the zk-snarks protocol -- fully written in JavaScript.

## Websnark

[Websnark](https://github.com/iden3/websnark) is a fast zk-snark proof generator written in native web assembly.

## Wasmbuilder

[Wasmbuilder](https://github.com/iden3/wasmbuilder) is a JavaScript library to simplify writing web assembly code.
