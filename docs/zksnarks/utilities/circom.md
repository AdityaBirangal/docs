# Circom

[Circom](https://github.com/iden3/circom) is a library that allows you to build circuits to be used in zero knowledge proofs. More formally, it's a circuit compiler for zk-snarks.

In particular, it's designed to work well with [snarkjs](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs): an independent implementation of the zk-snarks protocol -- fully written in JavaScript.

For a guide on how to get started with circom and snarkjs, see [here](../../guides/circom-and-snarkjs.md).
