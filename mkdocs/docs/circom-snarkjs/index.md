# Circom 2.0

> Circuit Compiler for ZK Proving Systems

[Circom](https://iden3.io/circom) is a novel domain-specific language for defining arithmetic circuits and its associated compiler written in Rust language.

Our open-source library of templates called [CircomLib](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib) is publicly available to practitioners and developers. The library contains multiple circuit templates that have been reviewed and proven to work by our research team.

The implementations of the proving systems are also available in our libraries: [SnarkJS](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs), written in Javascript and Pure Web Assembly; [wasmsnark](https://github.com/iden3/wasmsnark) written in native Web Assembly; and [rapidSnark](https://github.com/iden3/rapidsnark) written in C++ and Intel Assembly. Our team is currently working on the development of RapidPLONK and a run-time architecture for ARM processors.

This way, Circom aims to provide developers with a holistic framework to construct arithmetic circuits through an easy-to-use interface and abstract the complexity of the proving mechanisms.
