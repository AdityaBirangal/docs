# Getting Started

## Zero-knowledge proofs
If you want to get started writing [zero-knowledge](../key-concepts#zero-knowledge-proofs) proofs, have a look at [circom and snarkjs guide](../../circom-snarkjs).

It starts by covering the various techniques to write circuits for zero-knowledge proofs, then moves on to creating and verifying a proof off-chain, and finishes off by showing you how to do the same thing on-chain with Ethereum.
