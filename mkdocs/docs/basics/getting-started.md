# Getting Started

## Zero-knowledge Proofs
To learn how to create [zero-knowledge](../key-concepts#zero-knowledge-proofs) proofs, have a look at [circom and snarkjs guide](../../circom-snarkjs).

The process starts with employing various techniques of writing circuits for zero-knowledge proofs; it then moves on to creating and verifying a proof off-chain, and finishes off by showing you how to replicate the process on-chain with Ethereum.
