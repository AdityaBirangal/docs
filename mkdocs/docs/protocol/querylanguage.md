# Proof Query language

> Proof Query language specifications is still being built. Consider it work in progress.

## The goal of the query language

Initial idea is to have a generic circuit with the possibility to do a verification based on user claims.
As circuit setup is not a trivial task and especially the trusted setup is a challenging task to do for regular developers. We have to provide a simple generic query language based on generic prebuilt circuits.

But query language should not be limited only in use by specific atomic circuits, but also utilized in other circuits.

## Syntax

The first version planned to support only next operations : *>, <,  =, in and notin*  . Later on, this list could be extended

***Comparison operations***

- \> greater than
- <   less than
- =   equal to
- notin - matches none of the values
- in - matches one of the values

> *we have to use some syntax instead of raw signs as it will be inconvenient to use  signs <> =  in JS.   $eq as = , $gt as >,... more preferable way*
>

Simple operation

```json
{ <field>: { $eq: <value> } } - equal 
{ <field>: { $gt: <value> } } - greater then
{ <field>: { $lt: <value> } } - less then
{ <field>: { $nin: [<value>,<value>] } }
{ <field>: { $in: [<value>,<value>] } }
```

For atomic claim these operations could cover a lot of use-cases.

## Atomic circuit

> The first implementation will cover only simple atomic verification of one field.
It means we will do query requests only to one data field
But also we have to do all required service verifications like check ownership, revocation, expiration, etc...
>

We also have to include some additional attributes specific to the identity

- Schemas list
- List of trusted issuers
- Challenge

- *Example: a simple query*

```json
{
  "circuit_id": "attrQuery",
  "type": "zkp",
  "rules": {
    "query": [
      {
        "allowedIssuers": [
          "115zTGHKvFeFLPu3vF9Wx2gBqnxGnzvTpmkHPM2LCe"
        ],
        "schema": [
          {
            "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/main/schemas/json-ld/kyc-v2.json-ld",
            "type": "KYCAgeCredential"
          }
        ],
        "challenge": 12345678,
        "req": {
          "birthdate": {
            "$lt": 20000101
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Query circuit should accept query requests and also have to do mandatory verification.

Mandatory verification includes:

- Verify claim id ownership ( proof is generated by identity which is the subject of claim)
- Verify that claim is not revoked
- Verify that claim is not expired
- Verify that the identity key is not revoked

Query:

- Apply query request

Optional:

- Check schema
- Check issuer of the claim

> In some cases, *schema* and *issuer* could be not important. And in this case, we should leave the possibility to omit these fields

**List of signals for circuit**

Id ownership signal:

```
signal input id;
signal input hoIdenState;

signal input hoClaimsTreeRoot;
signal input authClaimMtp[IdOwnershipLevels];
signal input authClaim[8];

signal input hoRevTreeRoot;
signal input authClaimNonRevMtp[IdOwnershipLevels];
signal input authClaimNonRevMtpNoAux;
signal input authClaimNonRevMtpAuxHi;
signal input authClaimNonRevMtpAuxHv;

signal input hoRootsTreeRoot;

signal input challenge;
signal input challengeSignatureR8x;
signal input challengeSignatureR8y;
signal input challengeSignatureS;
```

Claim signals:

```
signal input claimSchema;
signal input claim[8];
signal input claimIssuanceMtp[IssuerLevels];
signal input claimIssuanceClaimsTreeRoot;
signal input claimIssuanceRevTreeRoot;
signal input claimIssuanceRootsTreeRoot;
signal input claimIssuanceIdenState;
signal input issuerID;
```

Verify claim revocation status:

```
signal input claimNonRevMtp[IssuerLevels];
signal input claimNonRevMtpNoAux;
signal input claimNonRevMtpAuxHi;
signal input claimNonRevMtpAuxHv;
signal input claimNonRevIssuerClaimsTreeRoot;
signal input claimNonRevIssuerRevTreeRoot;
signal input claimNonRevIssuerRootsTreeRoot;
signal input claimNonRevIssuerState;
```

Query request:

```
signal input slotIndex; // index of field slot in the claim
signal input value[valueArraySize]; // value for check
signal input operator; // >,<, =,in, notin operations of CQL
```

**Public inputs:**

```json
challenge,
id,
hoIdenState,
issuerID,
claimIssuanceIdenState,
claimSchema,
slotIndex,
operator,
value,
timestamp

```


## Proof request workflow

**Verifier â†’ User**

1. Verifier prepare proof request with a query to atomic circuit
- Request

```json
{
  "circuit_id": "attrQuery",
  "type": "zkp",
  "rules": {
    "query": [
      {
        "allowedIssuers": [
          "115zTGHKvFeFLPu3vF9Wx2gBqnxGnzvTpmkHPM2LCe"
        ],
        "schema": [
          {
            "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/main/schemas/json-ld/kyc-v2.json-ld",
            "type": "KYCAgeCredential"
          }
        ],
        "challenge": 12345678,
        "req": {
          "birthdate": {
            "$lt": 20000101
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

2. User parse a proof request and do necessary checks
   1. The circuit is known
   2. The schema is known
   3. Claims by the specified issuer persist in the wallet
   4. Get issuer public state for key non-revocation proof
   5. Prepare inputs for the circuit
      1. Prepare ownership / claim / issuer / query inputs
      2. Use schema to resolve field position in the claim
   6. Generate ZK proof
   7. Create proof sharing response protocol message and send it to the verifier

## Next steps

1. Make it possible to query multiple fields from the same schema, but still limits to only 4 available slots, 2 indexes, and 2 values. With this combination, we can cover the more advanced use case
2. Support more query operations
3. Fields combinations
4. Claim combinations
5. Represents JSON-LD document as a tree and stores root as a claim. Extend verifications to this new schema. Do an atomic query verification
6. Extended query schema with multifield verifications, from JSON-LD
